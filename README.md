# ado-workshop

In this repository, we'll explore a starter Azure DevOps Pipeline with basic concepts with a fun Mario twist. Each "world" corresponds to a specific topic, and each "level" represents a deeper dive into that topic.

## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for the KL&amp;A Conference 2024 - ADO Workshop - "It's-a me, Azure-io!" 🍄🌟

### Repository Structure

- **Branches (Worlds)**: Each branch represents a different Mario "world." These branches will guide you through various aspects of Azure DevOps Pipelines.
- **Commits (Levels)**: Within each branch, commits represent individual "levels." These levels cover specific concepts related to pipelines.

## Quick Start Guide

Follow these steps to get started with Azure DevOps Pipelines:

1. **Sign Up**: If you don't have an Azure DevOps account, sign up for a **free account** at Azure DevOps
	- Note: A free account does not get access to parallel jobs on Microsoft-hosted images.

2. **Clone this Repository**:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dchapman-kla/ado-workshop.git
```

3. **Navigate to the Desired World (Branch)**:
    
    - Each branch (world) corresponds to a specific topic. For example:
        - ‘world/one’: Building a .NET application, Scripting, Parameters, and more ...
        - ‘world/two’: Pipeline Jobs, Dependencies, and Artifacts
        - ‘world/three’: Pipeline Stages and Build Agents
    - No Warping!
	    - Don't skip to a world before completing the levels required. _Unless, you know what you are doing_ 🛠️🕶️
4. **Explore the Levels (Commits)**:
    
    - Within each branch, explore the commits (levels) to learn about different pipeline concepts.


Happy coding! 🍌🔧
